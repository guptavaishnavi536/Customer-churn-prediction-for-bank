# Customer-churn-prediction-for-bank
The application of Machine Learning (ML) in the banking industry has ushered in a disruptive era, revolutionizing the way financial organizations operate, service clients, and make decisions. It has helped banks increase 
operational efficiency, streamline operations, and deliver personalised services to their consumers by using the power of complicated algorithms and data analytics. Churn prediction focuses on detecting clients who are in risk of switching to a 
competitor or discontinuing services. It forecasts customer loss by using prior transactional data, customer interactions, and demographic data. These models are crucial in supporting banks in proactive client retention strategies, reducing revenue 
loss and safeguarding customer relationships. Churn prediction algorithms' predictive insights help banks to tailor their outreach efforts, offer tailored incentives, and provide superior customer experiences to high-risk consumers. This not only increases customer satisfaction but also contributes to overall 
business growth. In contrast, developing strong churn prediction models needs extensive data collecting. In this study, we have used a dataset including bank information for around 10,000 clients, as well as whether they have churned. Our aim is 
to create a model that can predict whether a client would churn. We performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and utilized Lazy Classifier, which includes roughly 29 pre-trained models, and Deep Neural Networks to assist us pick the best model based 
on accuracy and time consumed. 

Banks are essentially lenders that produce funds by borrowing from depositors and lending it to borrowers. They must, however, recruit and maintain customers to produce revenue. As a result, the purpose of banks, like any other business, is to maximize revenue and profits. Customer retention has a 
significant impact on profitability. According to research conducted by Bain & Company "increasing customer retention rates by 5% can increase profits by anywhere from 25% to 95%." This makes sense when we consider the 
economics of scale that support most institutions. In fact, studies suggest that, depending on the industry, acquiring a new client might cost five to seven times as much as keeping an existing one. Banks must devise innovative tactics to compete for 
new customers. Banks have never been hesitant to spend a lot of money on sales and marketing. However, the financial services industry has been slow to adopt internet-based solutions. According to a recent industry analysis of bank 
marketing budgets "the share of spend allotted to "online channels" climbed 71 percent from 2015 to 2017, from seven percent to 12 percent of overall marketing spend." ("Total marketing spend" includes sponsorships, corporate gifts, and 
corporate communications‚Äù). Customer Churn Prediction can help in identifying opportunities for building such novel and creative solutions. Churn Prediction, a critical use of Data Analytics and Machine Learning in the banking industry, identifies clients who are 
likely to switch to a competitor or terminate services. These algorithms assess customer attrition by analyzing historical transactional data, customer interactions, and demographic information, and they are critical in assisting banks in 
managing client retention strategies in a proactive manner, thereby reducing income loss and sustaining customer relationships. Using the predictive insights gained by churn prediction algorithms, banks may target high-risk consumers 
by changing outreach efforts, offering personalized incentives, and providing better customer experiences. This improves not just customer happiness but also overall business growth.
